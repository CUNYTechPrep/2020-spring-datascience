## Welcome to Week 1!

This week we do a deep dive on the pandas library in python, the most popular
library for data manipulation and analysis in python.  We also cover using
SQL in python.

Introduction to Pandas Lecture.ipynb contains the material presented in
lecture and will hopefully serve as a good resource to look up Pandas
syntax.  The three boston_housing csvs contain the data for this notebook.

Week1_Exercises.ipynb contains instructions for the lab portion of the class.
Listings.csv contains the data needed for these exercises.

Week1_Answers.ipynb contains the answers for the lab portion of the class.

Week1_SQL_lesson_exercises.ipynb is divided in two parts: the first part is a 
lesson of how to work with SQL database from Python interface. The second 
part contains practice exercises of the material covered.
