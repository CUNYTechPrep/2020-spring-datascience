## Week 4: Machine Learning Introduction, Regression

Now that we have a handle on how to use pandas to transform our data, we can start learning how to use the robust libraries built on top of pandas, like scikit-learn for machine learning.

Linear_Regression.ipynb contains this week's lesson.  In class you will develop your own model in the wine dataset. The goal is to build and optimize a linear regression model to predict alcohol content in wines based on the ingredients.
