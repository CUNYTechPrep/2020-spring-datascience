## Welcome to Week 2!

This week we will continue working with Pandas library and data types we
might find in a dataset. We also cover how to learn the statistics of a dataset
and how to visualize the descriptive statistics and particular trends using
the libraries `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

[This](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) is the official matplotlib pyplot tutorial.
[Here](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html) is another high quality guide on plotting with python, note that it consists of multiple pages you can navigate to at the top or bottom.
