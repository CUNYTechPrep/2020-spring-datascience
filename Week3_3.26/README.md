## Week 3: Machine Learning Introduction

Now that we have a handle on how to use pandas to transform our data, we can start learning how to use the robust libraries built on top of pandas, like scikit-learn for machine learning.

Machine_Learning_Introduction.ipynb contains this week's lesson.  In class you will develop your own model in Titanic_Example.ipynb using titanic.csv.

After you have developed your own model, go to the [titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) on kaggle, follow the instructions to create an account and submit your predictions on kaggle's own test set.  Kaggle's test set is in this repo as for_kaggle.csv.
